# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repository.

## What this is

Harmonicon: a rhythm game for diatonic and chromatic harmonica (Rust + Bevy
0.19). The player plays a *real* harmonica into the microphone; pitches are
detected in real time and scored against a scrolling chart. Goal: teach
blues/jazz harmonica through play.

Planning docs — keep these current as work lands; prune finished items rather
than accumulating history (git log/commit messages are the historical record):
- `TODO.md` — open, actionable items only
- `ROADMAP.md` — versioned feature direction (0.4 → 0.6+)
- `PLAN.md` — execution order and implementation notes for what's in flight
- `docs/lessons_plan.md` — curriculum design for the Lessons feature
- `docs/gameplay_validation.md` — manual + automated validation checklist;
  update it when changing gameplay/timing behaviour
- `docs/book/` — player-facing mdBook user guide (`mdbook build`/`mdbook
  serve` from that directory); update it when a user-visible feature
  changes, not just internal ones. `docs/book/src/images/*.png` are
  placeholder screenshots (script-generated captioned frames) pending real
  captures — keep the filenames stable when swapping them in so the
  `![...](images/foo.png)` references throughout `docs/book/src/*.md`
  don't need touching.

## Commands

```bash
cargo run --features dev,dynamic_linking   # local iteration; ~7s relink
cargo run --release             # playable build; never ship dev/dynamic_linking
cargo test --features dev       # 1106 tests, whole workspace, incl. doctests

# The two loops want different things, which is why dynamic_linking is its
# own feature rather than part of `dev`:
#   - running wants it: it drops a relink after a main.rs edit from ~91s to
#     ~7s, which dominates the edit/run cycle.
#   - testing cannot have it: rustdoc's doctest binary then fails to load
#     the dynamically-linked stdlib ("libstd-*.so: cannot open shared
#     object file") and every doctest errors.
# Never ship either — dynamic_linking needs libbevy_dylib*.so beside the
# binary, which packaged builds (e.g. the flatpak) don't bundle.

# Working on pure logic? Skip the engine entirely — seconds, not a minute:

cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings               # what CI runs

# Working on pure logic? Skip the engine entirely — seconds, not a minute:
cargo test -p harmonicon-core   # ~200 tests, no Bevy in its dependency tree
# Profiling: start the Tracy UI (https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy), click
# "Connect", then:
cargo run --release --features trace_tracy
```

Binaries: main game (`src/main.rs`), plus `hole-editor`, `note_editor`,
`note_bench`, `gen_synthetic_dataset` (in `src/bin/`). The root package is
*only* the binary — every library lives in `crates/`.
Manual testing needs a mic, audio out, and a display.

## Architecture (load-bearing facts)
- **Cargo workspace — eleven library crates plus a binary-only root
  package.** A crate may depend only on ones *earlier* in this list, and
  **peers may not depend on each other**:

  | Crate | Holds | Bevy? |
  |---|---|---|
  | `harmonicon-core` | music theory, chart types, scoring math, pitch/MIDI conversion, the harmonica synth, WAV, grid snapping | **no** |
  | `harmonicon-audio` | cpal capture, FFT pitch detection, waveform analysis | yes |
  | `harmonicon-platform` | asset discovery, localization, settings, theme, responsive | yes |
  | `harmonicon-song` | chart/manifest loading, MIDI-backed songs, lessons | yes |
  | `harmonicon-app` | state machine, routing flags, profile | yes |
  | `harmonicon-ui` | `dialogs`, `music_score`, `spectrogram` | yes |
  | `harmonicon-gameplay` | clock, judging, 2D/3D highways, overlays, bend trainer | yes |
  | `harmonicon-jam` / `harmonicon-editor` | Jam Session / Song Editor — **siblings**, neither imports the other | yes |
  | `harmonicon-menu` | page state machine, routing, one file per screen | yes |
  | `harmonicon-bench` | pitch-detection benchmark + dataset generator (dev tooling) | yes |
  | `harmonicon` (root) | `main.rs` + `src/bin/*`; owns `assets/`, `build.rs`, `tests/` | yes |

  - **Keep `harmonicon-core` Bevy-free.** Its whole dependency tree is
    `serde`/`serde_json`/`midly`, which is why its ~200 tests run in
    seconds. Anything needing `Resource`/`Component`/`App` belongs a level
    up. This is the single most valuable property of the split — don't
    trade it away for convenience.
  - **No re-export facades.** A call site names the crate it depends on
    (`harmonicon_core::chart`, `harmonicon_gameplay::gameplay::…`), so every
    dependency is visible where it's taken. Re-exporting a moved module
    under its old path was tried and deliberately removed: it hid which
    crate code came from and let modules reach for things casually.
  - **Cross-crate ordering goes through a `SystemSet`, never a system
    name.** `.after(some_private_fn)` forces the owning crate to make the
    system *and its parameter types* public. `dialogs::combobox::
    ComboboxEscapeSet` and `gameplay::plugin::MusicVolumeSet` exist for
    exactly this — publish an ordering point, keep the implementation
    private.
  - **A crate cycle is not expressible**, so Cargo enforces the layering.
    Rust still permits cyclic *modules* inside one crate, which is what
    `tests/physical_design.rs::no_module_dependency_cycles` catches (no
    allowlist — see `docs/physical_design_plan.md`).
  - **Paths reaching `assets/` from a crate need `../../`.** `include_str!`/
    `include_bytes!` resolve relative to the source file, and
    `env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR")` now points at the crate, not the repo.
    A wrong `include_*!` is a compile error; a wrong runtime path is not,
    so tests that read `assets/` must build the path explicitly rather than
    relying on the working directory.
  - **`assets_management`'s wasm manifest is generated by
    `harmonicon-platform`'s own `build.rs`**, because
    `include!(concat!(env!("OUT_DIR"), …))` reads the *including* crate's
    `OUT_DIR` and `OUT_DIR` is per-package. The workspace-root `build.rs`
    keeps the source-scanning lints (localization, message registration),
    which walk `src/` **and** every `crates/*/src/`.
  - **A new crate must forward the `dev`/`trace_tracy` features** to its own
    `bevy` (`"harmonicon-x/dev"`), or feature unification breaks and the
    tree ends up with two differently-configured Bevy builds.
- **Profiling is Tracy-based** — see `docs/profiling.md` for the whole
  story (why the `LogPlugin` filter is feature-gated, and which paths need
  a manual span because Bevy's per-system instrumentation can't reach
  them). Add a span for anything running off the main schedule (another
  thread, an asset loader, a decode task) or burning real time inside one
  system call.
- **Per-crate architecture notes live in `crates/<name>/CLAUDE.md`.** Each
  crate documents its own load-bearing facts; they load when you're working
  in that crate rather than all at once. Start there for anything
  subsystem-specific:

  | Crate | Its `CLAUDE.md` covers |
  |---|---|
  | `harmonicon-core` | (no separate file — pure logic, documented at its `//!` headers) |
  | `harmonicon-audio` | the cpal→FFT input path, chart-driven detection range |
  | `harmonicon-platform` | asset sources + the `~/Harmonicon` watcher, settings, compact layout |
  | `harmonicon-song` | chart format, schema migration, optional sibling assets, lessons |
  | `harmonicon-app` | `AppState`/`MenuPage` states, profile persistence |
  | `harmonicon-ui` | the Bravura notation staff |
  | `harmonicon-gameplay` | clock/time authority, scoring, adaptive difficulty, HUD, progress bar, call-and-response |
  | `harmonicon-jam` | generated manifests, jam lesson criteria, freeform call-response, MIDI stems |
  | `harmonicon-editor` | the whole Song Editor (record, MIDI import, undo, timeline tools, tempo map) |
  | `harmonicon-menu` | the guided tutorial tour, menu page scrolling |
  | `harmonicon-bench` | benchmark-first pitch-detection workflow |

## Procedural workflows

Three recurring jobs have their steps (and their traps) written up as
skills in `.claude/skills/`, loaded on demand rather than living here:

- **`add-lesson`** — authoring `assets/lessons/<unit>/<lesson>/`: manifest
  schema, pass criteria, prerequisites, what's honestly scoreable.
- **`add-crate`** — adding or extracting a workspace crate: extract
  bottom-up, forward the features, and what breaks on a move
  (`include_str!` depth, `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR`, `OUT_DIR`, the budget
  allowlist).
- **`add-locale-string`** — the three-locale parity rule and Fluent's
  `{$var}` syntax.

## Conventions (enforced or established)

- **UI is authored with `bsn!`** wherever applicable; widget callbacks go
  inline as `on(...)` observers — not `Changed<Interaction>` systems, not
  imperative `spawn().observe()`. Prefer `bevy_ui_widgets` over hand-rolled
  widgets; buttons go through the shared `dialogs/button.rs` widget unless
  there's a real reason not to. For a destructive action needing "are you
  sure?", use `dialogs::confirm_dialog` (`OpenConfirmDialog{purpose,
  message}` in, `ConfirmChosen{purpose, confirmed}` out — same
  message-based, `DialogId`-scoped shape as `dialogs::file_dialog`) rather
  than firing immediately or hand-rolling another modal; the Song Editor's
  Erase/Remove timeline tool (`song_editor::timeline`) is its first user.
- **Keyboard navigation:** every interactive element must use a real
  `bevy_ui_widgets` widget (explicit `use bevy::ui_widgets::Button as
  WidgetButton` — plain `bevy::prelude::*` resolves the bare `Button` name
  to `bevy_ui`'s *legacy*, pre-headless-widgets marker instead, which has
  no keyboard support at all) with `TabIndex(0)` attached, never a
  hand-rolled `Pointer<Click>` observer on a plain `Node`. Every screen's
  root needs a `TabGroup` (`bevy::input_focus::tab_navigation`) for
  Tab/Shift+Tab to scope to; a modal (a confirm/file dialog, an open
  combobox dropdown) needs `TabGroup::modal()` or its items' `TabIndex`
  flipped negative while closed (see `dialogs::combobox::
  set_combobox_open`) so Tab can't reach something invisible — bevy's own
  tab-gathering walks the ECS tree by `TabIndex`/`Children` alone, with no
  `Display`/`Visibility` check. `dialogs::keyboard_nav::KeyboardNavPlugin`
  registers `TabNavigationPlugin` (not in `DefaultPlugins`, unlike
  `InputFocusPlugin`) and paints the focus ring; it does **not** bridge
  `Activate` to `Pointer<Click>` — every click handler on a real
  `WidgetButton` is written directly as `On<Activate>` (`Activate` is what
  `bevy_ui_widgets::Button` fires for both a real click and a focused
  Enter/Space, so one handler covers both). An earlier version routed
  `Activate` through a synthetic re-triggered `Pointer<Click>` so ~130
  existing handlers wouldn't need retyping — that bridge could recurse
  into `bevy_ui_widgets`' own `button_on_pointer_click` (which reacts to
  the synthetic click and, seeing the real click's still-`Pressed`
  component, re-emits `Activate`) and overflow the stack on an ordinary
  mouse click. A new button-shaped click handler must therefore take
  `On<Activate>`, not `On<Pointer<Click>>` — and only ever on an entity
  that actually carries a real `WidgetButton`; retyping a handler on a
  legacy `bevy_ui::widget::Button` (or on a plain `Node` with no Button at
  all, e.g. the Song Editor's note-grid drag surfaces or harmonica-diagram
  cells) to `On<Activate>` doesn't fail to compile — it just silently
  never fires, since neither ever emits `Activate`. Multi-option pickers
  (radio-shaped, not "click to advance") should use `RadioGroup`/
  `RadioButton` (see `dialogs::tab_bar`) rather than a hand-rolled
  mutually-exclusive button row — only the group itself gets `TabIndex`,
  per WAI-ARIA convention (individual radio buttons aren't Tab stops; the
  group's own arrow-key handling reaches them). `Checkbox` needs no
  `Button` alongside it — it already has independent Enter/Space and
  click handling that doesn't go through `Activate`, and adding `Button`
  risks a double-toggle (see `dialogs::checkbox.rs`).
- **Bevy 0.19 scene spawning:** use `WorldAssetRoot(handle)` for GLB/scene
  assets, not `SceneRoot`.
- **Localization is enforced:** user-visible strings must come from
  `loc.msg()` (Fluent); a `build.rs` scan + `LocalizedStr` newtype fail the
  build on raw literals. Locales: en-US, pt-BR, es-ES — add keys to all;
  `locales_define_the_same_keys` walks the directory and enforces parity.
  **A key with a variable uses Fluent's own `{$name}` syntax** (e.g.
  `jam-generate-key = Key: {$key}`) — `LocalizationExt::msg_args`
  (`localization.rs`) builds a real `fluent::FluentArgs` from the
  `&[(&str, String)]` it's given and resolves it through
  `fluent_content::Request::args`/`Content::content`, i.e. Fluent's own
  `format_pattern`, not a hand-rolled string replace. One wrinkle:
  Fluent wraps every interpolated argument in bidi-isolation marks
  (FSI/PDI, U+2068/U+2069) by default, meant for prose mixing scripts —
  overkill for short single-language UI labels, and `bevy_fluent`'s
  bundle loader exposes no setting to turn it off
  (`FluentBundle::set_use_isolating` isn't reachable through it), so
  `msg_args` strips those marks from the result via the pure, tested
  `strip_bidi_isolates` helper rather than let invisible formatting
  characters leak into rendered/logged text. `msg` (no args) skips all of
  this — it's a plain `self.content(key)` lookup, no `FluentArgs` involved.
  Runtime *loading* of those locales (`localization::load_locales`) is a
  fixed `LOCALES` list, each loaded by explicit path
  (`locales/<lang>/main.ftl.ron`), not `AssetServer::load_folder` — the
  wasm build's HTTP asset reader can't enumerate a directory
  (`bevy_asset::io::wasm::HttpWasmAssetReader`), and `load_folder` needing
  exactly that is what used to hard-panic the game on startup under wasm
  (`bevy_fluent`'s `LocalizationBuilder::build` indexing an empty map).
  `locales_const_matches_the_assets_directory` keeps `LOCALES` honest
  against what's actually on disk, since nothing else does anymore now
  that nothing scans the directory at runtime. The same directory-listing
  constraint applies to anything else that might run under wasm.
  `assets_management`'s song/note-theme/harmonica-model discovery
  (`scan_all_songs`, `scan_note_themes`, `scan_harmonica_models`,
  `scan_ui_themes`) takes the build-time-manifest approach instead: each is
  now two `#[cfg]`-gated implementations under the same name — the original
  `std::fs::read_dir`-based body, unchanged, behind
  `#[cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))]` (this is what keeps native dynamic:
  a player can still drop a new song into `assets/songs/` or
  `~/Harmonicon/songs/` with no rebuild — a fixed manifest like
  localization's `LOCALES` isn't an option here, unlike the fixed set of
  three shipped locales), and a `#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]` sibling
  that reads a `build.rs`-generated manifest instead
  (`generate_wasm_asset_manifest`, `assets_management::manifest`'s
  `include!(concat!(env!("OUT_DIR"), "/asset_manifest.rs"))`). Generating
  that manifest at build time — rather than runtime — works specifically
  because a build script always runs on the native host and can do a real
  `std::fs::read_dir` walk of `assets/` regardless of the crate's own
  `--target`; `build.rs`'s `generate_wasm_asset_manifest` mirrors each scan
  function's discovery rule exactly (e.g. the first `*.harpchart` file
  directly under a song's `song/` subfolder) so the two implementations
  can't drift. The `~/Harmonicon` external-folder equivalent has no wasm
  version at all — no home directory concept in a browser — which the
  native functions already handle gracefully (`dirs::home_dir()` returning
  `None`), so nothing wasm-specific was needed there. UI *theme* content
  (not just names) also loads under wasm now: `theme::load_theme` used to
  read `theme.json`'s contents via a raw `std::fs::read_to_string`, which
  can't work under wasm either (a different mechanism than a directory
  listing — an actual file read) — `ThemeJson` is now an `Asset` loaded
  through a small custom `ThemeJsonLoader` (`AssetLoader`, matching
  `song::loader::SongChartLoader`'s pattern; registered by full filename,
  `extensions() -> &["theme.json"]`, so it can't collide with some other
  `.json` asset gaining its own loader later), fetched the same way
  `load_theme` already loaded its sibling images/sounds. Loading is now
  two systems instead of one synchronous function: `request_theme_load`
  (on `SelectedTheme` change) clears `LoadedTheme` and kicks off the
  `asset_server.load::<ThemeJson>(...)` call, stashing the `Handle` in a
  `PendingTheme` resource; `apply_theme_when_loaded` polls it every frame
  (a no-op whenever `PendingTheme` is absent) and populates `LoadedTheme`
  once the load resolves. `theme_source_prefix` (bundled vs.
  `external://`) is also `#[cfg]`-split the same way as the
  `assets_management` scan functions above — its native body does a real
  `Path::is_dir()` check, which needs a real local filesystem wasm doesn't
  have; the wasm sibling always answers "bundled", correct because
  `AvailableThemes` under wasm only ever lists bundled themes to begin
  with (same no-external-folder reasoning as everywhere else here).
- **Message registration is enforced:** `build.rs` also scans for every
  `#[derive(Message)]` type and fails the build if it's never registered
  with `.add_message::<T>()` anywhere — an unregistered message otherwise
  compiles fine and only panics at runtime ("Message not initialized") the
  first time some system's `MessageReader`/`MessageWriter` for it actually
  runs, which can be well after the type was added.
- **Audio synthesis:** vibrato/FM must integrate frequency over time (phase
  accumulation), never `modulated_freq × t` — the latter drifts pitch upward.
- **Testing style:** new mechanics get pure functions + unit tests first,
  ECS systems second. Scoring/chart/pitch logic all have dense test modules —
  match that. ECS behaviour is tested with minimal `World` + `Schedule` or
  `App` + `StatesPlugin` (see `menu/mod.rs`, `gameplay/tests.rs`).
- **Commits:** no `Co-Authored-By` trailer (see "Rules that override
  defaults" below — this one is hook- and CI-enforced). Chart schema changes
  must stay backward compatible (new fields optional); bump
  `metadata.format_version`.

## Rules that override defaults

Most conventions above describe how this codebase already works, so
following them is the path of least resistance. The ones below instead
*contradict* a common default, which means they have to win on every single
occurrence — and that is exactly the kind of rule that erodes silently. The
`Co-Authored-By` one was violated 19 commits in a row before anyone noticed,
because prose is not a check.

| Rule | The default it overrides | Enforced by |
|---|---|---|
| No `Co-Authored-By` trailer on commits | most tooling and assistants add one automatically | `scripts/git-hooks/commit-msg` + the `commit_messages` CI job |
| Click handlers are `On<Activate>`, never `On<Pointer<Click>>` | `Pointer<Click>` is the obvious Bevy reflex, and compiles fine — it just skips keyboard users | `build.rs` (`pointer_click_violations`); a genuinely non-button surface opts out with a `not-a-widget-button:` comment |
| `WorldAssetRoot`, not `SceneRoot`, for GLB/scene assets | `SceneRoot` is what Bevy examples show | nothing yet |
| Vibrato integrates frequency over time, never `freq × t` | the naive form looks right and drifts pitch upward | nothing yet |

**If you add a rule to this table, add a check with it.** Anything here
without one is a known liability, not a settled convention.
