# Controls Reference

Harmonicon is played with your **harmonica and microphone** — the keyboard
and mouse are only for navigating menus and controlling playback, never
for playing notes.

## Global

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Esc` | Pause/resume during a song; go back one menu level otherwise. |
| Mouse | All menu navigation and pause-menu buttons. |

## During gameplay (Play 2D / Play 3D / Jam Session)

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `M` | Mute/unmute the metronome click (visual beat indicator keeps working). |
| `V` | Cycle the spectrogram's visual style. |

A **⏸** button in the bottom-right corner does the same thing as `Esc` for
pausing — no keyboard required.

## Song Editor

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Y` | Undo / redo |
| `Ctrl+C` / `Ctrl+V` | Copy the selection / paste it at the mouse position |
| `Delete` / `Backspace` | Delete the selection |
| `←` / `→` | Pan the grid |
| `Esc` | Clear the selection, or back out of the editor |

See [Song Editor](song-editor.md) for everything else — grid snap modes,
multi-selection, the metronome/count-in, and more.

## Menus and dialogs

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `↑` / `↓` (Arrow Up/Down) | Adjust the UI's overall zoom/scale. |
| `Esc` | Close an open dropdown, cancel a file dialog, or back out one menu level — whichever applies where you are. |

## Pause menu (mouse-driven)

The pause menu itself is buttons and sliders, not keybindings, but it's
worth knowing what's there since it's easy to miss mid-song. It's two
columns: transport actions on the left, practice aids on the right.

- **Resume**, **Restart**, **Quit Song** (left column)
- **Wait for Note** — freeze the highway/music at the next unhit note
- **Practice Speed** — a slider, 50%–100%
- **A–B Loop** — drag on the song-progress bar to set a loop range;
  **Clear Loop** removes it
- **Adaptive Difficulty** toggle; override a phrase by clicking its
  rectangle on the progress bar's bottom strip, then dragging the
  **Learned** slider

See [Playing a Song](playing-a-song.md#pausing-and-quitting) for what each
of these actually does.
