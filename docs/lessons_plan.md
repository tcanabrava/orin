# Lessons: curriculum & engine design

Design doc for the Lessons feature (`ROADMAP.md` 0.4 → 0.6). Covers what's
shipped (wave 1, compactly), the scoring primitives lessons are built from,
and the plan for the next batch of exercises (wave 2). Read this before
writing any lesson code — `PLAN.md`'s Lessons entry just points here.

A note on sourcing: this curriculum was drafted from general, widely-taught
blues/jazz harmonica pedagogy (single note → tongue blocking → bending →
12-bar form → positions → improvisation is the standard progression taught
by most harmonica method books and instructors), not from a specific
external source. If you have a particular curriculum or reference you want
the lesson order/content matched to, share it and this doc should be
revised against it before content authoring continues.

## Design principle: honest about what's scoreable

The engine judges *pitch* (and, for a few modifiers, amplitude/timing
patterns). Some technique topics change *how* a player produces a note
without changing the note itself — the mic literally cannot tell puckering
from tongue blocking if both land on the same clean single note. Every
lesson is tagged:

- **Scored** — an existing (or a small, new) scoring primitive judges it
  directly.
- **Scored via proxy** — can't verify the technique itself, but can verify
  a musical outcome that requires it (e.g. tongue blocking is unverifiable,
  but the octave splits it enables are; "ta-ka" tonguing is unverifiable,
  but rapid same-hole re-articulation — which the fresh-attack gate
  genuinely requires — is not).
- **Instructional only** — text/diagram content plus (optionally) a normal
  note-hit chart to practice on; the game cannot verify the technique
  choice, only that the player is playing the notes.

Don't build scoring machinery for something in the last category — that's
effort spent on a check that can't actually check anything.

## Wave 1 — shipped

Units 1–2 and the whole engine are live. `assets/lessons/`:

- **Unit 1 "How to blow"** (`01_blowing/`): `single-note` (clean-attack),
  `hand-wah` (wah oscillation), `multiple-notes` (chord targets),
  `tongue-blocking` (instructional), `octave-split` (chord targets),
  `slides` (adjacent-hole run + bend release).
- **Unit 2 "Counting the blues"** (`02_rhythm/`): `twelve-bar`
  (instructional + overlay), `call-response` (call-and-response
  primitive), `improvisation` (open jam, scale adherence),
  `using-your-feet` (tight-window timing pulse).

Prerequisite chains: Unit 1 is `single-note → {hand-wah, multiple-notes →
tongue-blocking → octave-split, slides}`; Unit 2 is `twelve-bar →
{call-response → improvisation, using-your-feet}`.

The scoring primitives all this rides on (architecture detail in
`CLAUDE.md`; each was built once and is reusable by any future lesson):

1. **Clean single note** — `scoring::is_clean_attack`, tallied as the
   `SongStats::clean_attack` technique bucket, judged via
   `PassCriteria::Technique { technique: "clean-attack" }`.
2. **Chord targets** — multi-event `TrackItem`s (`PlayMode::Chord`/`Split`)
   score only when `scoring::chord_is_sounding` sees every sibling pitch at
   once; plain accuracy already reflects it, no dedicated criterion needed.
3. **Scale adherence** — `jam_session::ImprovStats` (fresh-attack-gated
   `chord_tone`/`in_scale`/`out_of_scale` counters over an open jam),
   judged by `PassCriteria::ScaleAdherence` via the "Finish Lesson" pause
   button.
4. **Call-and-response** — `TrackItem::call: true` phrase groups are
   synthesized into an audible demo and their response notes force-freeze
   the clock (`ScheduledNote::force_wait`), scored by the normal pipeline.
5. **Modifier scoring** (predates lessons, fully reusable) — `Bend` /
   `Overblow` / `Overdraw` / `Slide` validated at onset via `target_pitch`;
   `Vibrato` / `WahWah` validated from sustain samples against the chart's
   `oscillation_hz` (±40%). Each has its own `SongStats` technique bucket
   usable in `PassCriteria::Technique`.

Also available to charts and relevant below: `tick` + tempo-map timing
(accelerando is chartable), `Song::feel: Shuffle` (swung metronome),
per-chart scoring windows (how `using-your-feet` tightens timing), and
`Progression` (standard / quick-change / minor) for jam backings.

## Wave 2, part 1 — shipped

Unit 1's harmonica-basics extensions, Unit 2's bar-counting drills, and the
train trio are all live — 12 lessons, `assets/lessons/`:

- **Unit 1 additions** (`01_blowing/`): `breathing` (`07_breathing`,
  clean-attack sustain), `first-bend` (`08_first_bend`, the 4-draw
  half-step, `bend` technique), `deep-bends` (`09_deep_bends`, 2/3-draw
  half- and whole-step bends), `vibrato` (`10_vibrato`, sustain
  oscillation), `articulation` (`11_articulation`, "ta-ka" tonguing via the
  fresh-attack proxy).
- **Unit 2 additions** (`02_rhythm/`): `counting-four` (`05_counting_four`),
  `bar-counting` (`06_bar_counting`, 2D/4B/4D roots over the 12-bar form,
  2nd position), `turnaround` (`07_turnaround`, rests through the form to
  the bar-12 landing), `shuffle-feel` (`08_shuffle_feel`, `feel: shuffle`
  swung pairs), then the train trio: `train-chug` (`09_train_chug`, chord
  targets), `train-rolling` (`10_train_rolling` — the first bundled chart
  built on `tick` + a tempo map instead of fixed seconds, a genuine
  end-to-end exercise of that timing path), `train-whistle`
  (`11_train_whistle`, chord targets + wah oscillation combined).
- **All three wave-2 engine items are built** (see "Engine work" below,
  kept for reference): `PassCriteria::ChordToneAdherence`, the lesson
  manifest's `progression` field, and `PassCriteria::PhraseDiscipline` +
  `jam_session::in_rest_window`/`ImprovStats::rest_violations`. Nothing
  left to build for the rest of wave 2 — what remains below is pure content
  authoring.

## Wave 2, part 2 — shipped

Unit 3, the bridge from drills to *music*, is live — 7 lessons,
`assets/lessons/03_blues/`. Licks are taught call-and-response — the
primitive built in wave 1 for exactly this — and improvisation deepens from
"stay in the scale" (wave 1's `improvisation`) to chord-tone targeting and
phrasing. All charts are original scale/chord-tone/vocabulary drills (the
safe-to-author subset per `TODO.md`); nothing melodic or rights-sensitive.

| Lesson (id, folder) | Scoreable? | Mechanism | Prereq | Pass |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **The blues scale** (`blues-scale`, `01_blues_scale`) — 2nd-position blues scale up and down: 2D · 3D' · 4B · 4D' · 4D · 5D · 6B (needs the two bends, which is why bending comes first) | **Scored** | Plain chart + existing bend scoring | `deep-bends` (Unit 1) | accuracy ≥ 0.6 |
| **First licks** (`first-licks`, `02_first_licks`) — three short original licks (three blues-scale notes each, no bends: 2D-3D-4B, 4B-4D-5D, 6B-5D-4D), each taught call-and-response | **Scored** | Call-and-response primitive, unchanged | `call-response` (Unit 2) | accuracy ≥ 0.7 (frozen waits make this pitch-recognition, not timing — same rationale as `call-response`) |
| **Bent licks** (`bent-licks`, `03_bent_licks`) — licks built around 3D' and 4D' ("the crying notes"), call-and-response | **Scored** | Call-and-response + bend scoring | `first-licks`, `deep-bends` | technique `bend` ≥ 0.5 |
| **Licks over the changes** (`licks-over-changes`, `04_licks_over_changes`) — a full 12-bar chorus placing one lick per chord (adapted to I/IV/V), phrase-tagged per 4-bar line so the phrase overlay shows the form | **Scored** | Plain chart over the 12-bar; combines everything above | `bent-licks`, `bar-counting` | accuracy ≥ 0.6 |
| **Chord-tone improvisation** (`chord-tone-improv`, `05_chord_tone_improv`) — open jam; don't just stay in the scale, *land on chord tones* when the chord changes | **Scored via proxy** | `PassCriteria::ChordToneAdherence`, reads `ImprovStats::chord_tone_adherence()` | `improvisation` (Unit 2), `blues-scale` | chord-tone fraction ≥ 0.4 |
| **Minor blues** (`minor-blues-improv`, `06_minor_blues`) — improvise over the minor blues progression; body copy covers what changes (b3 is home now) | **Scored via proxy** | `Progression::Minor` — the lesson manifest's `progression: "minor"` field seeds `menu::JamProgression` on Start | `chord-tone-improv` | `ScaleAdherence` ≥ 0.8 |
| **Question & answer** (`question-answer`, `07_question_answer`) — phrasing: improvise for 2 bars, *rest* for 2 bars, alternating through the form; leaving space is the lesson | **Scored via proxy** | `PassCriteria::PhraseDiscipline`, reads `ImprovStats::phrase_discipline()`; the 2-on/2-off pattern is fixed (`jam_session::PHRASE_PLAY_BARS`/`PHRASE_REST_BARS`) | `improvisation` | phrase discipline ≥ 0.7 |
| **Quick change improvisation** (`quick-change-improv`, `08_quick_change_improv`) — added in wave 3 (below), but lives here since it's blues-scale improv, not a new scale; same open jam as `improvisation`, backing progression set to `Progression::QuickChange` | **Scored via proxy** | `PassCriteria::ScaleAdherence` — existing `progression` manifest field, zero engine work | `improvisation` | `ScaleAdherence` ≥ 0.8 |

Like the `improvisation` lesson it builds on, each of the jam-criteria
lessons still needs a minimal `chart` field — a single long placeholder
`TrackItem` spanning the jam, supplying `song.key`/`harmonica` for
`JamHoleGuide` construction — even though no notes are individually scored.
(An earlier draft of this doc said these three needed "no chart"; that was
imprecise — the code has always required one, and the shipped lessons
follow that pattern.)

## Wave 3 — Scales and Improvisation — shipped

A new unit, `04_scales/` (`unit: "scales"`), 6 lessons — the direct
response to "there's nothing here about scales other than blues, or
improvising over anything but the blues scale." Two parts:

1. **Scale run drills, content-only** — three fixed charts teaching scale
   *shapes* the way `blues-scale` (Unit 3) already does, scored by plain
   accuracy: `major-scale` (1st position, reusing `deep-bends`'s
   whole-step draw bends for F/A), `minor-pentatonic-scale` (2nd
   position — literally the shipped `blues-scale` chart's fingering minus
   its flatted-5th step, since minor pentatonic *is* the blues hexatonic
   minus one degree), and `country-scale` (1st position major pentatonic,
   no bending at all — the accessible entry point of the three, unlocked
   off `multiple-notes` instead of `deep-bends`).
2. **True non-blues jam improvisation, needing new engine work** — Jam
   Session's live hole-map/scale-adherence feedback
   (`jam::session::JamHoleGuide`) was hardcoded to
   `blues_scale_classes` regardless of what a lesson or "Generate Jam"
   picked. Fixed by a new `JamScale` resource (`src/app.rs`, mirrors the
   existing `JamProgression`) plus a `LessonManifest::scale` field
   (mirrors `progression`, parsed by `menu::pages::lessons::parse_scale`)
   — `major-scale-improv` and `minor-pentatonic-improv` are the first
   lessons to actually exercise it, each pairing with its run-drill
   sibling (`song.key` matches, so the same notes taught in the drill are
   what the jam judges against). A chart's own declared
   `Harmonica::scale()` still wins over `JamScale` when it sets one (see
   `jam::session::setup`); "Generate Jam" also grew a Scale combobox
   alongside Progression/Position so this isn't lesson-only.

| Lesson (id, folder) | Scoreable? | Mechanism | Prereq | Pass |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **The major scale** (`major-scale`, `01_major_scale`) — 1st-position major scale up and down: 1B · 1D · 2B · 2D'' · 3B · 3D'' · 3D · 4B (the two `''` steps are the whole-step draw bends from `deep-bends`) | **Scored** | Plain chart + existing bend scoring | `deep-bends` (Unit 1) | accuracy ≥ 0.6 |
| **Minor pentatonic scale** (`minor-pentatonic-scale`, `02_minor_pentatonic_scale`) — 2nd-position minor pentatonic: `blues-scale`'s own fingering minus its 4D' (flatted 5th) step | **Scored** | Plain chart, reuses `blues-scale`'s bend | `blues-scale` (Unit 3) | accuracy ≥ 0.6 |
| **The Country scale** (`country-scale`, `03_country_scale`) — 1st-position major pentatonic, all-natural notes, no bending: 1B · 1D · 2B · 2D · 4B · 4D · 5B · 6B · 6D | **Scored** | Plain chart, no bend/technique scoring needed | `multiple-notes` (Unit 1) | accuracy ≥ 0.6 |
| **Major scale improvisation** (`major-scale-improv`, `04_major_scale_improv`) — open jam judged against the plain major scale instead of blues | **Scored via proxy** | `PassCriteria::ScaleAdherence` + `"scale": "major"` (new `JamScale` engine work) | `major-scale`, `improvisation` | `ScaleAdherence` ≥ 0.8 |
| **Minor pentatonic improvisation** (`minor-pentatonic-improv`, `05_minor_pentatonic_improv`) — open jam judged against the minor pentatonic scale | **Scored via proxy** | `PassCriteria::ScaleAdherence` + `"scale": "minor-pentatonic"` | `minor-pentatonic-scale`, `improvisation` | `ScaleAdherence` ≥ 0.8 |

`quick-change-improv` (content-only, no new scale) is the 6th lesson of
this wave but lives in `03_blues/` — see its row in Unit 3's table above.

**Known gap, not built in this wave:** the Song Editor's lesson-authoring
form (`song_editor::lesson_form`) still only round-trips `progression`,
not the new `scale` field — authoring a scale-based jam lesson through
the editor UI means hand-editing `lesson.json`'s `"scale"` key afterward.
Small, bounded follow-up if the editor UI is ever extended (mirror
`progression`'s existing click-to-cycle field).

### Unit 5 — jazz (`05_jazz/`) — 4 of 5 lessons shipped

Its own engine work (jazz chord-tone tables, a jazz-blues `Progression`
variant) was already done before this unit's content — see "Engine work
(done)" below — so all four drills below needed zero further engine
changes, only content:

| Lesson (id, folder) | Scoreable? | Mechanism | Prereq | Pass |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Swing eighths** (`swing-eighths`, `01_swing_eighths`) — swung-eighth drills at a tighter timing window than `shuffle-feel`, alternating a 4-hole and a 5-hole blow/draw pair | **Scored** | `feel: shuffle` + tighter per-chart windows (100/220/380ms vs. `shuffle-feel`'s 150/350/550), zero engine work | `shuffle-feel` (Unit 2) | accuracy ≥ 0.6 |
| **ii-V-I chord tones** (`ii-v-i-chord-tones`, `02_ii_v_i_chord_tones`) — the Dm7-G7-Cmaj7 turnaround in C, each chord arpeggiated low to high | **Scored** | Plain chart, notes computed from `song::harmonica::ii_v_i_chords("C", false)`; reuses `deep-bends`'s whole-step draw bends for F/A | `swing-eighths`, `deep-bends` (Unit 1) | accuracy ≥ 0.6 |
| **The jazz blues form** (`jazz-blues-form`, `03_jazz_blues_form`) — open jam over the full jazz-blues progression (a real ii-V-I turnaround in the last few bars) | **Scored via proxy** | `PassCriteria::ChordToneAdherence` + existing `progression: "jazz-blues"` field — the same mechanism `minor-blues-improv`/`quick-change-improv` already use, just a different `Progression` value | `ii-v-i-chord-tones`, `chord-tone-improv` (Unit 3) | chord-tone fraction ≥ 0.4 |
| **Chromatic slide basics** (`chromatic-slide-basics`, `04_chromatic_slide_basics`) — a full ascending/descending chromatic scale on a 12-hole chromatic harp, computed directly from the chromatic layout tables (not transcribed) | **Scored** | `Modifier::Slide` onset scoring, already built; first bundled chromatic lesson content | `swing-eighths` | technique `slide` ≥ 0.5 |
| **Jazz heads** — actual repertoire | **Scored** | Ordinary charts | Rights-sensitive: public-domain only, human judgment required (`TODO.md`) — **deliberately not built**; needs specific pieces confirmed public domain before charting |

### Engine work (done)

All three wave-2 engine items are built (see "Wave 2, part 1 — shipped"
above): `PassCriteria::ChordToneAdherence`/`PhraseDiscipline`, the lesson
manifest's `progression` field, and `jam_session::in_rest_window` +
`ImprovStats::rest_violations`/`chord_tone_adherence`/`phrase_discipline`.
`menu::lessons::is_jam_criteria` routes all three jam-based criteria (plus
`ScaleAdherence`) into `GameplayMode::JamSession`;
`gameplay::pause_menu::jam_fraction_for` picks the right `ImprovStats`
fraction for whichever criterion a given lesson declares. Unit 3 (above)
used every one of these with no further engine changes. Wave 3's `JamScale`
resource + `LessonManifest::scale` field (see above) is the other piece of
engine work landed so far. Unit 5 (jazz) below needed none of its own —
every mechanism its four shipped lessons use already existed; only "jazz
heads" (rights-blocked content, not an engine gap) remains.

Cross-cutting authoring notes:

- Every new lesson: `lesson.json` + locale keys in all three languages
  (`tests/asset_layout.rs` enforces schema, prereq integrity, and key
  existence — it will catch omissions).
- Cross-unit prerequisites (`train-chug` ← `multiple-notes`,
  `blues-scale` ← `deep-bends`) are just ids — `is_unlocked` doesn't care
  about units — but double-check the lesson list UI presents a locked
  lesson's prerequisite name legibly when it lives in another unit.
- New charts using only existing schema features need no `format_version`
  bump; `train-rolling`'s tempo map and the multi-modifier charts all use
  long-supported fields.

### Suggested build order (what's left)

Units 3 and 4 (scales) are fully shipped. Unit 5 (jazz) is 4/5 lessons
shipped — all that's left of the lessons curriculum is **jazz heads**,
blocked on picking specific repertoire someone has actually confirmed is
public domain (not just "probably fine"); see that row above.
