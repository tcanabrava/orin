//! A scrolling music-notation staff, rendered with the

//! by the Song Editor and both gameplay render modes, all three of which
//! spawn [`spawn_music_score`] wherever their own layout calls for it and
//! drive it by writing [`MusicScoreNotes`]/[`MusicScorePlayhead`].
//!
//! Deliberately not full music engraving. It does draw: noteheads
//! (whole/half/filled by duration), stems, ledger lines, sharp
//! accidentals, ties across a bar line ([`split_at_bar_lines`]), bar lines
//! and a time signature ([`MusicScoreMeter`]), one of three clefs picked
//! from the music's own range ([`choose_clef`]), and beams joining short
//! notes within a beat ([`beam_groups`]).
//!
//! It does not: slant a beam (they are horizontal, with every stem in a
//! group drawn to one shared line), draw a second beam or flag tier
//! (anything shorter than an eighth still rounds up to one), handle dotted
//! durations, or change clef or meter mid-piece — both are chosen once for
//! the whole song, because either changing under a moving playhead would
//! be unreadable. This is a supplementary
//! visual, not a sight-reading tool (the Song Editor's own tab readout
//! already exists for players who want exact rhythm) — see
//! `docs/lessons_plan.md`'s framing of the tab readout for the same
//! reasoning applied here.
//!
//! Every glyph's relative geometry (notehead width, stem attachment point,
//! ledger-line extension) is taken directly from Bravura's own published
//! `bravura_metadata.json` (values in "staff spaces," SMuFL's own unit —
//! 1 staff space is the gap between two adjacent staff lines), not
//! estimated. The one thing that *couldn't* be derived that way:
//! [`GLYPH_BASELINE_CORRECTION`] — see its own doc comment for why, and
//! flag it as the first thing to adjust by eye if glyphs don't look
//! vertically centered on their staff position.
