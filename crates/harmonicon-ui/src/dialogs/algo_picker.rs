//! Shared pitch-detection algorithm picker: a [`combobox`] whose tooltip
//! explains whichever algorithm is selected, instead of a separate static
//! panel. Used on the Options page; in the Bending Trainer, so a player can
//! quickly compare algorithms while actually bending notes; and in the Song
//! Editor's Record mode, since a take reads pitches off the same global
//! detector. All three drive the same global [`AudioSettings::
//! pitch_algorithm`] via [`on_algo_selected`], so picking one anywhere takes
//! effect everywhere immediately.
