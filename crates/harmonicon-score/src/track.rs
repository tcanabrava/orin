//! Finding the harmonica part in a file that wasn't written for us.
//!
//! A Guitar Pro tab or a MIDI arrangement usually has a dozen tracks, of
//! which at most one is a harmonica. Guessing wrong is worse than asking:
//! a guitar track mapped onto a harp is mostly notes it cannot reach, and
//! playing that is a far worse experience than a track picker.
