//! Says so, during play, when something makes the game unable to score what
//! the player is doing.
//!
//! Every warning here shares one shape: notes scroll past, nothing scores,
//! and from the player's seat the game isn't broken — *they* are. Each was
//! reported nowhere, or only on the Options page, which is somewhere a
//! confused player has no reason to go.
//!
//! One banner rather than one per problem, because they'd occupy the same
//! strip of screen and overlap. [`warning_key`] picks by priority:
//!
//! 1. **The microphone isn't working.** Nothing can score. Dominates.
//! 2. **The chart has chords and the chosen detector is monophonic.** Those
//!    specific notes can never score (`scoring::chord_is_sounding` needs
//!    every pitch at once), while the rest of the song plays normally — so
//!    it reads as being inexplicably bad at a few notes.
//!
//! Spawned for every mode under `AppState::Playing`. Jam Session isn't
//! scored, but it still feeds back against what it hears, so a deaf one is
//! just as misleading; the chord warning simply never fires there, since
//! Jam Session builds no `SongNotes`.
