//! The first-launch greeting.
//!
//! Harmonicon does nothing useful without a working microphone, and until
//! this page existed a new player was shown four buttons — Play, Options,
//! Help / About, Quit — none of which says so. Microphone setup was reachable
//! only by opening Options and reading it, and the guided tour only from
//! inside Help / About. This page puts all three first steps in front of the
//! player once, on the launch where they're actually needed.
//!
//! Reached only via `harmonicon_app::profile::FirstRun`, which
//! `menu::routing::route_menu_entry` consumes; no other page navigates here.
//!
//! **"Set up your microphone" goes to Options, not straight to latency
//! calibration.** The first-run question is "does the game hear me at all",
//! which Options answers — it holds the input-device picker and the
//! `MicStatus` banner, and offers calibration from there for the player who
//! wants it. Latency calibration is a refinement, and it also always returns
//! to Options anyway (`ReturnToOptions`), so routing through it first would
//! just be a detour.
