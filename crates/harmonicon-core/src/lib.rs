//! Harmonicon's pure-logic core: no Bevy, no ECS, no I/O beyond a couple of
//! plain file writes.
//!
//! Everything here is the bottom of `docs/physical_design_plan.md`'s level
//! order — the music theory (`harmonica`, `chart`, `note_parser`), the
//! scoring maths (`scoring`), pitch/MIDI conversion (`midi`), and the
//! crash-safe config write (`config_file`). The game crate re-exports these
//! under their historical paths (`crate::chart`, `crate::scoring`,
//! `crate::midi`, ...), so call sites read exactly as before.
//!
//! Being a separate crate is what *enforces* the layering: Cargo cannot
//! express a circular dependency, so nothing here can ever reach back up
//! into gameplay, UI or asset loading.
