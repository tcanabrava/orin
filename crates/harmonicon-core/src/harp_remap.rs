//! Playing a chart on a harmonica other than the one it was written for.
//!
//! A chart declares its harp, and every expected pitch derives from that
//! harp's layout. A player who owns a different key has two coherent
//! choices, and they are opposites:
//!
//! - [`HarpMapping::SameHoles`] — keep the tab, let the music transpose.
//!   Hole 4 draw stays hole 4 draw; on a G harp it simply sounds a fifth
//!   away from what a C harp would. This is how a harmonica player already
//!   thinks: the tab *is* the piece, and the key is whichever harp is in
//!   your pocket.
//! - [`HarpMapping::Transpose`] — keep the music, recompute the tab. The
//!   piece sounds as written; the holes change, and some notes may need a
//!   bend or an overblow they didn't before, or become unreachable.
//!
//! **The load-bearing property is that `midi` is what the microphone will
//! hear.** Scoring compares detected pitch against it, so if it ever
//! disagrees with what the player's harp physically produces, the game
//! listens for a note nobody can play and scores nothing. Every function
//! here exists to keep that one field honest.
//!
//! One trap worth stating outright: a chart event may carry an explicit
//! `note`, and in practice every bundled event does. That name describes
//! the *chart's own* harp. Under `SameHoles` it must be ignored and
//! re-derived, or the expected pitch silently stays on the original harp
//! while the player blows a different one — the exact failure this module
//! is meant to prevent, and one that would affect every shipped chart.
