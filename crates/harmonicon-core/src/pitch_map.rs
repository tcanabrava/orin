//! Resolving a MIDI pitch onto a harmonica: which hole, breath direction and
//! technique produces it, and which harp key fits a set of notes best.
//!
//! The inverse of [`Harmonica::wind_direction_midi`], which answers "what
//! does this hole sound like". Everything that has to put arbitrary music
//! onto a harp needs this direction instead: MIDI import, live recording,
//! importing other score formats, and transposing a chart onto whichever
//! harmonica the player actually owns.
//!
//! It lived in `harmonicon-editor`'s `song_editor::pitch_map` until those
//! last two needed it — a crate above gameplay, so neither could reach it.
//! Here it is Bevy-free and reachable from anywhere.
//!
//! Stated in core's own vocabulary ([`Action`], [`Harmonica`]) rather than
//! the editor's parallel `Dir`/`Pitch`/`HarmonicaKind` enums, and the harp
//! family is read from the [`Harmonica`] itself instead of being passed
//! alongside it — a `Chromatic` harp with a `Diatonic` kind argument was
//! always a bug waiting to happen.
