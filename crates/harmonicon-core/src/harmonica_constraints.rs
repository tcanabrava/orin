//! Post-detection harmonica-constraint filtering — the "Harmonica
//! Constraint Solver" stage from `Harmonica Note Detection Roadmap.md`
//! (repo root, not checked in): a harmonica's reed plate only responds to
//! one wind direction at a time, so a raw detector's simultaneous
//! candidate pitch set (e.g. `PitchAlgorithm::Nmf`'s activations) can
//! still contain a physically impossible mix — a pitch only reachable by
//! blowing alongside one only reachable by drawing, which no single
//! breath can produce. This module is pure post-processing over a
//! `Harmonica` plus a candidate MIDI pitch set; it doesn't know or care
//! which detector produced the candidates, so it composes with any of
//! them (most usefully the polyphonic ones).
//!
//! Deliberately lives under `song::`, not `audio_system::`: `Harmonica` is
//! a `song` type, and `song` already depends on `audio_system` (never the
//! other way — see `docs/physical_design_plan.md`'s "dependencies point
//! downward"), so a detector-output filter that needs the harmonica model
//! can't live inside `audio_system::pitch_detect` itself without inverting
//! that. Callers that have both a detector's raw output and the active
//! chart's `Harmonica` (`note_bench`, and eventually the live gameplay
//! pitch-gate path) apply this as a separate step instead.
