//! Microphone permission, where the platform has one.
//!
//! Two functions with the same names on every target: [`microphone_granted`]
//! and [`request_microphone`]. Desktop has no runtime permission model, so
//! there it answers "granted" and requesting is a no-op — the whole flow in
//! [`audio_input`](crate::audio_input) is then written once, unconditionally,
//! with no `#[cfg]` at the call site.
//!
//! Android is the target that actually needs it: `RECORD_AUDIO` is a
//! "dangerous" permission, so since API 23 it must be granted by the user at
//! runtime, and until it is, opening a cpal input stream fails. That failure
//! is indistinguishable from a broken device, which is why
//! [`MicStatus::AwaitingPermission`](crate::audio_input::MicStatus) exists
//! separately from `Failed`.
