//! Records notes played live on a real harmonica straight onto the note
//! grid — the Song Editor's live counterpart to `midi_import`, sharing that
//! module's pitch resolution instead of reading MIDI file bytes. The
//! microphone/pitch-detection pipeline (`main.rs`'s `process_audio`) already
//! runs continuously in the background regardless of `AppState` — the same
//! [`PitchEvent`] stream the Song Editor's own Practice mode already
//! consumes (`practice::practice_tick`) — so recording needs no capture
//! lifecycle of its own, just a per-pitch onset/release diff against
//! successive events.
//!
//! A note is pushed onto the grid the instant its onset is detected (at
//! minimum length) rather than only once it's released, and its length is
//! grown every frame while it's held — so the player watches the note
//! appear and extend in real time, the same way any other DAW's live
//! recording works, instead of a note only appearing once they stop
//! playing it.
//!
//! Unlike gameplay scoring — which tolerates raw detector noise because it
//! only compares detections against the chart's expected notes — recording
//! has no chart to lean on, so it defends itself three ways, all set up
//! once at [`start_record`] rather than per event:
//! - [`PitchRange`] is narrowed to the selected harp's own range (the same
//!   thing gameplay does from a loaded chart), so the detector never even
//!   searches where this harp can't sound;
//! - a precomputed 128-entry MIDI→(hole, dir, pitch) table
//!   ([`build_pitch_table`], backed by `map_pitch_playable`) resolves each
//!   detection, *discarding* pitches the harp can't produce instead of
//!   letting MIDI import's nearest-note fallback disguise noise as a
//!   plausible hole;
//! - onsets are provisional until seen in [`CONFIRM_EVENTS`] consecutive
//!   pitch events (a one-chunk blip is deleted again, so the live-growing
//!   UX costs nothing), and releases get [`RELEASE_GRACE_EVENTS`] events of
//!   grace (a one-chunk dropout doesn't split a held note in two).
//!
//! Recording also *punches in*: a note you play replaces whatever the grid
//! already had at that time — any note overlapping a newly recorded note's
//! span is removed, unless it was itself created during the current take
//! ([`RecordState::take_ids`] — a chord's simultaneous notes are all part
//! of the take and must coexist). So re-recording over a finished take (or
//! over hand-placed/imported notes) replaces them instead of layering
//! impossible blow-and-draw-at-once combinations on top.
