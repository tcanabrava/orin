//! Reuses `audio_system::synth`'s additive harmonica voice via
//! `playback::note_freq`/`render_pcm`, the same synth Play/Practice/Record
//! preview already use.
//!
//! Scoped to *selection changing to a different note*: a fresh placement or
//! clicking an existing note both go through `EditorState::selected_note`,
//! so neither call site needs touching. Re-clicking an already-selected
