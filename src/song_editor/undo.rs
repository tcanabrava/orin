//! Undo/redo for the note grid — `Ctrl+Z`/`Ctrl+Y` (see
//! `interaction::handle_undo_redo`) step through a history of the editor's
//! *content*: [`EditorState::notes`]/[`EditorState::tempo_changes`], the
//! two places a mistake is destructive rather than trivially undone by
//! clicking again (unlike a click-to-cycle meta field or a plain toggle).
//! Every other `EditorState` field is deliberately excluded — undoing a
//! note edit shouldn't rewind an unrelated scroll position or field.
//!
//! Snapshot-based, not command-based: [`track_changes`] runs every frame
//! `EditorState` changes and diffs against the last-seen snapshot, pushing
//! the *previous* one onto the undo stack only when content actually
//! differs — no instrumentation needed at each note-mutating call site.
//! The one exception is live recording (`record::RecordState::active`):
//! notes grow every frame during a take, so [`track_changes`] skips while
//! one is active, collapsing the whole take into one undo step.
