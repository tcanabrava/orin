//! Keyboard focus navigation: registers `bevy_input_focus`'s Tab/Shift+Tab
//! cycling (not part of `DefaultPlugins`, unlike `InputFocusPlugin`/
//! `InputDispatchPlugin`, which already are) and paints a visible focus
//! ring on whichever entity currently has keyboard focus.
//!
//! Keyboard activation itself needs no bridge here: every button-shaped
//! widget in the app is spawned as a real `bevy_ui_widgets::Button`
//! (`use bevy::ui_widgets::Button as WidgetButton` — plain
//! `bevy::prelude::*` resolves the bare `Button` name to `bevy_ui`'s
//! *legacy*, pre-headless-widgets marker instead, which has no keyboard
//! support at all), and every click handler in this codebase is written
//! as `on(...): On<Activate>` rather than `On<Pointer<Click>>` — `Activate`
//! is `bevy_ui_widgets::Button`'s own unified "this was activated" event,
//! fired for a real click *and* a focused Enter/Space alike (see
//! `button_on_pointer_click`/`button_on_key_event` in the vendored crate).
//! An earlier version of this module instead re-triggered a synthetic
//! `Pointer<Click>` from `Activate` to avoid retyping every click handler
//! — that bridge could recurse into itself through `bevy_ui_widgets`' own
//! `button_on_pointer_click` (which reacts to the synthetic click and,
//! seeing a real click's still-`Pressed` component, re-emits `Activate`)
//! and overflow the stack on a genuine mouse click. Writing every handler
//! directly against `Activate` removes the recursive path entirely rather
//! than trying to out-guard it.
