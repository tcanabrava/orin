//! Shared "is the window small enough to need a compact layout" signal —
//! [`CompactLayout`], read by gameplay 2D/3D and the Song Editor to decide
//! which of two layouts to spawn. No live-reflow: each screen reads this
//! once when it's entered (`OnEnter(AppState::Playing)` /
//! `OnEnter(AppState::SongEditor2)`), not continuously, so resizing the
//! window mid-session doesn't retroactively change an already-spawned
//! screen's layout — deliberately, to avoid needing despawn/respawn logic
//! for a scenario (resizing *during* a song or edit session) that matters
//! far less than "the screen you land on already fits."
