//! Dev-only screen capture, driven from *outside* the running game over the
//! Bevy Remote Protocol (`bevy_remote`, JSON-RPC on `127.0.0.1:15702`).
//!
//! The point of routing this through BRP rather than a keybind or a
//! frame-counter is that nothing about *when* to capture is baked into the
//! game. An external tool decides, at any moment, as often as it likes — and
//! can mutate world state first (`world.mutate_resources`) and capture the
//! result in the same breath, with no rebuild.
//!
//! Two entry points, both spawned from outside:
//!
//! - **A still:** spawn an entity with bevy's own `Screenshot` component
//!   (it is `Reflect` and registered by `ScreenshotPlugin`, so BRP's
//!   `world.spawn_entity` can create one). [`save_capture`] writes it to
//!   [`SCREENSHOT_DIR`].
//! - **A clip:** set [`VideoCapture::frames_left`] via
//!   `world.mutate_resources`. [`drive_video_capture`] then spawns one
//!   screenshot per frame until it runs out, numbering them into a
//!   per-recording directory under [`VIDEO_DIR`]. Encoding to an actual
//!   video file is left to `ffmpeg` outside the game — see
//!   `docs/remote_control.md`.
//!
//! Navigation is the other half of this, and mostly needs no code here:
//! `NextState<AppState>`/`NextState<MenuPage>` are reflected, so
//! `world.mutate_resources` reaches any screen that needs no prior
//! selection. The ones that *do* need one — a song picked, a jam
//! generated, the guided tour started — are reached by clicking their
//! button, which is why this plugin registers `Activate`.
//!
//! Never shipped: BRP is an unauthenticated RPC server that can read and
//! mutate arbitrary world state, which is fine bound to localhost on a
//! developer's machine and nowhere else. Gated on `--features dev`, which
//! (unlike a runtime flag) keeps the whole module out of a release build.
