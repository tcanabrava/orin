# TODO

Open, actionable items only — once something lands, delete it from here
rather than annotating it done (git log and commit messages are the
historical record; see `CLAUDE.md`).

## 1.0 blockers (desktop)

See `ROADMAP.md`'s 1.0 section for the bar and `PLAN.md` for the order.

- [ ] **A monophonic pitch algorithm makes chord items unhittable, silently.**
  `scoring::chord_is_sounding` needs every pitch of a chord present at once,
  and YIN/pYIN/MPM resolve one fundamental by construction — measured, pYIN
  and MPM turn D4+G4 into a phantom F4, a note nobody played. So selecting
  one of those in Options quietly made every chord in a chart impossible.
  The picker now marks them ("single notes only") and an in-play banner
  fires when the loaded song actually contains chords. **Still open:** the
  Song Editor gives no such warning while authoring a chord, and nothing
  stops the combination outright — both deliberate, since the two warnings
  cover the moments it bites.
- [ ] **No blues content is bundled**, though blues/jazz is the project's
  stated theme: all 11 shipped charts are demos or public-domain classical/
  traditional. Same rights-and-judgment constraint as the content item
  below — **not to be authored unsupervised**.

## Bring your own harp, bring your own songs (post-1.0)

`ROADMAP.md` has the reasoning, `PLAN.md` the order. Phase 0 blocks both.

- [ ] **The pitch↔hole mapper is trapped in `harmonicon-editor`.**
  `song_editor::pitch_map`'s `map_pitch`/`map_pitch_playable` are the tree's
  only inverse mapping and are `pub(super)` in a crate above gameplay.
  Move to `harmonicon-core`, re-expressed in core's own `Action`/`Modifier`
  vocabulary instead of the editor's `Dir`/`Pitch`/`HarmonicaKind`.
- [ ] **The mapper can't do overblows or overdraws.** It resolves exact
  notes, bends within `max_bend`'s per-hole caps, and the chromatic slide —
  nothing else. Reaching the notes a diatonic harp otherwise can't make
  means adding them (Richter: overblow on 1/4/5/6, overdraw on 7/9/10), and
  computing the resulting pitch into the note's own `note` field, since
  `Modifier::Overblow` deliberately doesn't imply it.
- [ ] **A chart's harmonica is a hard requirement.** Own a G harp and a
  C-harp chart is unplayable. Needs an `EffectiveHarmonica` resource, a
  pre-play picker, and the two mapping modes (same holes / transpose).
- [ ] **The mic must listen to the harp being played, not the one written
  down.** `expected_pitch`, `PitchRange` and `ValidHarpNotes` all derive
  from `chart.harmonica` today; all three have to follow the effective harp
  or the game listens for pitches the player cannot produce. Test it
  directly: every expected pitch must be in the effective harp's own
  `build_valid_notes()`.
- [ ] **No score format but `.harpchart` can be played.** Needs
  `harmonicon-score` (Bevy-free, above core, below song) with one trait
  over `.harpchart`, MIDI and Guitar Pro, plus track auto-selection by name
  (`harmonica`/`gaita`/`mouth harp`/`blues harp`) and a picker when nothing
  matches.
- [ ] **Guitar Pro support rests on an unverified crate.** `guitarpro`
  (MIT, v0.4.3) is a candidate; its gp3/gp4 API is unconfirmed and gpx is a
  different container entirely (GP6 BCFS, GP7 zipped XML). Spike before
  designing on it.

## Mobile (post-1.0)

- [ ] **`CompactLayout` is width-only.** `responsive::is_compact` takes just
  an effective *width* against a 900 px breakpoint, but a phone in landscape
  is wide and **short** — 2400x1080, roughly 400 logical px tall at Android
  DPI — so nothing in the app adapts to limited height. The Song Editor
  works around it (left toolbar, Details tab, two-finger pan), but Play
  2D/3D have the same exposure and no workaround. A height-aware breakpoint
  fixes it once for every screen rather than per-page.
- [ ] **Touch gestures are unverified on real hardware.** The two-finger pan
  and the toolbar's drag-scroll are unit-tested and the sidebar was checked
  on an emulator, but multi-touch can't be scripted there (`adb shell input`
  has no multi-touch; raw `sendevent` never reaches the app). See
  `contributing/src/android-build.md`.

## Content

- [ ] **Only one bundled example artist** (`assets/songs/Example Artist`,
  three example songs used for 2D/3D/fallback testing). Ship a starter
  pack of public-domain blues heads/riffs across difficulties before wider
  release. **Deliberately not attempted unsupervised**: authoring
  rights-clear, well-judged chart content needs real musical judgment.
- [ ] **Lessons content, Unit 4 "jazz" (0.6).** Wave 2 (harmonica-basics
  extensions, bar-counting drills, the train trio, and the new Unit 3
  blues-vocabulary unit — licks via call-and-response, chord-tone/
  minor-blues/phrase-discipline improvisation) is fully shipped, and Unit
  4's own engine prerequisites (jazz chord-tone tables, the jazz-blues
  `Progression` variant) are now done too — see `docs/lessons_plan.md`.
  What's left is authoring the actual jazz unit content. Original
  arpeggio/vocabulary drills are the safe-to-author subset; actual
  jazz-standard repertoire needs the same rights judgment as the item
  above.

## Known open items (design detail)

Moved out of `CLAUDE.md`: these are status, not load-bearing
architecture, so they belong with the rest of the planning docs.

- Content: besides the Example Artist gameplay demos, bundled songs now
  include public-domain melodies (Greensleeves on a G harp, Jesu Joy and
  the Toccata in D minor on C harps, Für Elise on a C chromatic,
  "O Pulo da Gaita" transcribed from the Mr. Dirsom harmonica tab score,
  Amazing Grace, the Hallelujah chorus from Handel's Messiah on a D harp,
  and Mulher Rendeira). `tests/asset_layout.rs` schema-validates every
  bundled song chart. Deliberately skipped as still under copyright:
  Feira de Mangaio (Sivuca/Glorinha Gadelha) and Asa Branca (Luiz
  Gonzaga/Humberto Teixeira) — chart those yourself via Record mode
  instead of bundling a transcription.
- **Song editor color legend**: a third meta-form column
  (`meta_form::spawn_color_legend`) explains every color the editor uses,
  grouped by where it appears — note technique colors in the grid
  (`state::pitch_color`; direction is the ↑/↓ arrow glyph, not a color),
  the out-of-scale red tint, the selected-note border, drag-ghost valid/
  invalid, and the timeline/scrollbar colors — deliberately calling out
  that the scrollbar minimap's blue/orange means blow/draw
  (`interaction::SCROLLBAR_BLOW_COLOR`/`SCROLLBAR_DRAW_COLOR`), a
  different meaning than the grid note's blue (which means the Normal
  technique, regardless of blow/draw). Several colors that were private
  `const`s or local `let` bindings (`grid::OUT_OF_SCALE_TINT`/
  `TEMPO_MARKER_COLOR`, `timeline_overlay::SPLIT_LINE_COLOR`/
  `RANGE_HIGHLIGHT_COLOR`) were widened to `pub(super)` so the legend
  reuses the exact values instead of duplicating literals that could
  drift out of sync.
- **Song editor: selectable scale** (`song::chart::Scale`, a new chart
  field): the grid's out-of-scale red tint used to always mean "outside
  the blues scale rooted on the harp key" unconditionally
  (`blues_scale_classes(&state.key)`); it's now `state.scale.classes(&state.
  key)`, `state.scale` picked via a combobox (`meta_form::
  spawn_scale_combobox`) — six options: 1st/2nd/3rd position (the blues
  hexatonic, same shape as everywhere else, just rooted at the harp key
  \+0/+7/+2 semitones — the same offsets `Position::interval_below_jam_key`
  uses for Jam Session's harp-picking, just applied upward from the harp's
  own key instead of downward from a separate jam key, since a chart has
  no jam key distinct from its harp) and Major/Minor Pentatonic/Country
  (alternative *shapes*, always rooted on the harp key — for melodies that
  aren't blues-vocabulary at all; "Country" = major pentatonic, the
  scale 2nd-position cross-harp playing reaches without bending, per
  harmonica-pedagogy convention). `FirstPosition` (the default, used when
  a chart doesn't set `scale` at all) reproduces the old unconditional-
  blues behavior exactly — `first_position_matches_blues_scale_classes_
  exactly` pins this down. `harmonica.scale` is a new, schema-`enum`-
  validated field (unlike its free-string `position` sibling), added to
  both `Harmonica::Diatonic`/`::Chromatic`; `CURRENT_FORMAT_VERSION`
  bumped to 1.2.0 since an older build's stricter schema would otherwise
  reject a chart that actually sets it with a confusing raw validation
  error instead of the intended "needs a newer Harmonicon" message — a
  chart that never sets `scale` needs no version bump, unaffected either
  way. The combobox itself is spawned once into a reserved
  `ScaleComboboxSlot` (`spawn_scale_combobox`, a `Without<Children>`
  spawn-once gate, unlike the MIDI track combobox's rebuild-on-message
  pattern, since `Scale::all()`'s option list never changes at runtime);
  Load pushes a different value into the already-spawned combobox by
  writing `ComboboxValue` directly (`sync_scale_combobox_value`) — the
  widget's own documented escape hatch for exactly this, `dialogs::
  combobox`'s always-on `sync_combobox_visuals` picks the change up from
  there. No existing bundled chart sets `harmonica.scale` — all keep
  reading as 1st position, i.e. unchanged from before this feature.
  **`ScaleComboboxSlot` lives in the fixed chrome** (`ui::
  spawn_fixed_chrome`, above the mod panel — not the scrollable meta form
  the rest of the fields are in), a deliberate, load-bearing placement:
  `bevy_ui_widgets::Popover`'s dropdown list must be a literal ECS child of
  its toggle to compute its own position, and Bevy's UI overflow clipping
  follows that same ancestry rather than the popover's computed screen
  position — a combobox nested inside the form's `Overflow::scroll_y()`
  `ScrollArea` gets its open dropdown clipped to that scroll viewport no
  matter how high its `GlobalZIndex` is, rendering behind (and stealing
  clicks from) whatever's in the unclipped fixed chrome instead. The MIDI
  track combobox has this same latent constraint (it's also inside that
  `ScrollArea`) but hasn't surfaced as a visible bug yet — if it ever does,
  the fix is the same: move its slot out of the scrollable area too.
  **Fixing the clipping surfaced a second, separate bug in `dialogs::
  combobox` itself, affecting every combobox, not just Scale's**:
  `Pointer<Click>` auto-propagates up the entity hierarchy (every
  `bevy_picking` pointer event does, `#[entity_event(propagate =
  PointerTraversal, auto_propagate)]`) — clicking a dropdown item bubbled
  the same click up to the toggle button (`list`'s ancestor), whose own
  `toggle_click` observer then saw the popup `item_click` had *just* closed
  and immediately reopened it, so picking an item never visually closed
  the dropdown. Fixed by calling `ev.propagate(false)` in all three of the
  widget's own click observers (`toggle_click`/`backdrop_click`/
  `item_click`) — a modal widget shouldn't leak its own clicks to whatever
  it happens to be nested inside, regardless of this specific bug.
- **Lessons**: engine, all five primitives, and the full wave 1 + wave 2
  content pass (Units 1–3, 19 lessons) are shipped — see
  `docs/lessons_plan.md`. Unit 4 "jazz"'s engine prerequisites are also done
  (`song::harmonica::ii_v_i_chords`, `ChordQuality::{Major7,
  HalfDiminished7,Dominant7Alt}`, `Progression::JazzBlues`); what's left is
  content only, the same rights/judgment-sensitive gap as blues content
  (`TODO.md`).
- Remaining 0.4 work (recorded backing loops) — see `ROADMAP.md`/`PLAN.md`.
